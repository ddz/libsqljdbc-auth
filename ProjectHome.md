libsqljdbc\_auth provides support for using Windows integrated
authentication with the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver under Unix operating systems.  SQL Server Authentication is not secure and difficult to manage in an environment with large numbers of database servers, but it is often the only option when connecting to a SQL Server Database from non-Windows operating systems.  This library allows users of other operating systems to use the more secure Integrated Authentication method with Microsoft's SQL Server 2005 JDBC driver using native Kerberos authentication libraries.
