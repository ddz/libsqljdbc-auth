			   libsqljdbc_auth

DESCRIPTION

libsqljdbc_auth provides support for using Windows integrated
authentication with the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver under
Unix operating systems.  SQL Server Authentication is not secure and
difficult to manage in an environment with large numbers of database
servers, but it is often the only option when connecting to a SQL
Server Database from non-Windows operating systems.  This library
allows users of other operating systems to use the more secure
Integrated Authentication method with Microsoft's SQL Server 2005 JDBC
driver using native Kerberos authentication libraries.

INSTALLATION

$ ./configure --with-sqljdbc=/path/to/sqljdbc.jar
$ make
# make install

USAGE

To use the library, make sure that libsqljdbc_auth.so is in Java's
library path by either installing it into a standard location, or
setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH and/or the java.library.path system property.

Once that is done, if you specify 'integratedSecurity=true' in your
JDBC URL, the connection to the database will be authenticated with
Kerberos.

TROUBLESHOOTING

This library uses Kerberos, so your Kerberos environment and session
must be correctly setup.  In particular, first check the following:
  - You have a valid krbtgt listed in output of 'klist'
  - You can obtain a Kerberos ticket for the remote database.  Attempt
    a connection using this library and verify that 'klist' lists a
    ticket with a principal like: MSSQLSvc/<hostname>:<port>@<realm>.

libsqljdbc_auth uses Java Logging, just as Microsoft's SQL Server JDBC
driver does.  To trace execution of the driver and this library,
create a logging properties file containing the following:

handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.level=ALL
java.lang.level=ALL
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=ALL

Specify this file with the system property
java.util.logging.config.file=<logging.properties> and attempt a
database connection to gather a trace-level log.
